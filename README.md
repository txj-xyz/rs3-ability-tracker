  <h3 align="center">RS3 Ability Tracker</h3>

  <p align="center">
  This Ability tracker is based off <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> and is supported via keyevents from te Node Addon API <a href="https://github.com/SnosMe/uiohook-napi">uiohook-napi</a>, the Electron backend passes matched keys to an HTML frontend window called "Ability Window" and displays the matched keys, this project is my first Electron idea that has some use for the RuneScape community, It's a good learning experience and I've had a lot of fun using it.

## Building

- You can build the project by reading the `package.json` file to get an idea of what needs to be done.

This project is not anywhere near done in functionality at the time of you reading this, the README will be updated accordingly however you're welcome to go through and read the code.

Releases will be auto-built and posted under the [Releases Page](https://github.com/txj-xyz/rs3-ability-tracker/releases) using GitHub Workflows.

We use [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) for building into Installers and Zip files with a pre-compiled `asar` given to compress the data.

    
## Things to Note

 - Currently this is a Work in Progress and is not functioning.
 - There will be a major Interface rework.
